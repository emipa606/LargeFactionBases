Generate larger faction bases. Their size and manpower evolve with time. It also factors in the difficulty level, and some randomness. A high-risk, high-reward challenge.

Safe to add/remove in-game.

For compatibility with other mods changing faction bases, check [Choose your enemy base](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2366709688) from  [BrokenBed](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036011663/myworkshopfiles/).
